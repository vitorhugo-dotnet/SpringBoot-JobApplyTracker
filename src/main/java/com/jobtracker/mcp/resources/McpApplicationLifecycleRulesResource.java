                The application status and the `archived` flag represent different concepts and MUST be handled independently.

                ## Status semantics

                - `Rejected`: the company or recruiter rejected the candidate or decided not to continue the hiring process.
                - `Approved`: the candidate was approved.
                - Other statuses represent the current stage of an active hiring process.
                - Changing an application to `Rejected` or `Approved` MUST NOT archive it.

                When the user says `rejected`, `retorno negativo`, `não avançou`, `não passou`, or `empresa recusou`:

                1. Call `Update-Application-Status` with `Rejected` after obtaining the valid status value from `List-Statuses`.
                2. Keep `archived = false`.
                3. Do not call `Archive-Application` unless the user separately and explicitly requests archival.

                When the user says `dar baixa` while providing or showing a rejection message, interpret it as a status-only
                update to `Rejected`, not as an archive request.

                ## Archive semantics

                Archiving is a soft-delete operation used only when the candidate no longer intends to proceed with the
                application record, for example:

                - the candidate decided not to apply;
                - the candidate withdrew from the process;
                - the vacancy is incompatible and the candidate abandoned the application;
                - the record is a duplicate, test, invalid, or obsolete entry;
                - the user explicitly asks to archive the application.

                An archived application is hidden from the normal active list but preserved for historical purposes.
                Preserve its current status when archiving.

                ## Mandatory behavior

                - Never infer that a terminal status requires archiving.
                - Never call `Archive-Application` after setting `Rejected` or `Approved` unless the user explicitly requested archival.
                - When archival intent is ambiguous, do not archive. Ask for clarification when clarification is necessary.
                - Always apply the least destructive mutation necessary to fulfill the request.
                - Use `Restore-Application` to make an archived record active again. Restoration preserves the current status and all other data.
                - Permanent deletion is allowed only when the user explicitly requests permanent deletion.
                - Do not delete and recreate an application to change its archive state without explicit user approval.

                ## Examples

                User: `A empresa não avançou, dá baixa.`
                Action: set status to `Rejected`. Do not archive.

                User: `Desisti dessa vaga, pode arquivar.`
                Action: archive the application. Preserve its current status.

                User: `Essa candidatura foi criada por engano.`
                Action: archive it. Delete it only if the user explicitly requests permanent deletion.

                User: `Recebi uma rejeição.`
                Action: set status to `Rejected`. Keep the record visible and non-archived.

                User: `Arquivei por engano, restaure.`
                Action: call `Restore-Application`. Preserve the current status.
