The authenticated endpoint is `POST /api/v1/assistant/chat` and produces
`text/event-stream`. A POST SSE stream is intentional: the browser client should use
`fetch()` and consume its `ReadableStream`; native `EventSource` cannot send a JSON body.

Events:

- `token`: `{"content":"..."}`
- `complete`: `{"sources":["APPLICATION_STATS"]}`
- `error`: a sanitized provider failure

Enable with `APP_ASSISTANT_ENABLED=true`, set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and optionally set
`OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL`. The feature is disabled by default. Every tool is read-only and binds
the user ID captured from the authenticated request; the model never receives a user ID.

MariaDB FULLTEXT handles ordinary terms. The bounded LIKE fallback is used only for explicitly
recognized short technology tokens (`Go`, `AI`, `C#`, `C++`, and `.NET`) and remains
user-scoped, filtered, escaped, ordered, and capped. Redis, RabbitMQ, embeddings, persistent
chat memory, model routing, and mutation tools remain outside this MVP.
